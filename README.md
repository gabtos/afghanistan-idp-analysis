Using United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) survey and World Bank data, this project detects and diagnoses displacement following the change in authority in Afghanistan in August, 2021.

The project was conducted as part of an ongoing study led by Dr. Austin Wright at the University of Chicago in collaboration with the United Nations and the World Bank. 

In summary this project:

* Detects patterns of displacement
* Evaluates the representativeness of data derived from cellphone mobility and population information
* Identifies factors that contribute to financial distress, and a lack of access to public services, health, and adequate food supplies
